            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
             I am currently a Partner Integration Analyst onboarding lenders to the software via backend XML configurations
             and deployments while managing multiple projects at once. I work directly with customers testing in QA and production
              to ensure connection between systems is successful. Over the past 2 years, I have become very interested in the Web3, Blockchain and Crypto space and
              am I am currently enhancing my skills to become more knowledgeable and to become a Solidity/Blockchain developer. I believe smart contracts will change every
              industry and will make everyday routines more efficient and decentralized giving more power to the individual. Below is some more information about me and other web-development projects I worked on. I am profificient in HTML/CSS
              and I am learning more about React and Next.JS as I build projects based around Solidity.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I am currently working on a Web3 project that is a demo marketplace to auction real estate foreclosures with Next.js and Solidity.</p>
